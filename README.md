Seattle Harmonic Tidal Time Series Analysis using NOAA (Python)
- Used 4 months of real NOAA water level measurements (6-minute intervals) from a Seattle station  to perform harmonic tidal analysis
- Fit 13 parameters from 6 astronomical constituents (3 semi-diurnal + 3 diurnal) to tidal data using least squares minimization, achieving R2 =0.98
- Identified systematic residual patterns indicating missing longer-period constituents, demonstrating model success and limitation with 4-month dataset.
